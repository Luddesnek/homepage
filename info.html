            Linux is commonly defined as an operating system that utilizes the Linux kernel.
            The kernel serves as the core program of the operating system, facilitating 
            communication between the hardware components and the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Linux itself is a kernel, creating a complete operating system 
            requires a multitude of other programs and utilities to make it functional 
            and interactive. When Linux is referred to as an operating system, it typically
            indicates an operating system that utilizes the Linux kernel. These variations
            are commonly known as Linux distributions or distros.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built upon the Linux kernel.
            These distributions share many similarities with each other. They are often 
            constructed using the GNU Project, which consists of various smaller components
            and programs that collaborate to form an operating system. This is why Linux 
            is sometimes referred to as GNU/Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary distinguishing factor among different distributions lies in their
            choice of package managers. Package managers are programs responsible for 
            handling the system's software packages. One notable distribution, Debian,
            has served as the foundation for numerous other distributions, 
            including the popular Ubuntu. Debian-based distributions share the same package manager. 
            Debian's package manager prioritizes stability, ensuring that packages are maintained for
            extended periods and updates are infrequent. Consequently, Debian-based distributions are
            renowned for their stability, as long as the maintained packages remain stable.
