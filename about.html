	A website I made just to have a website, or basically

	Why not?
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
	Just some dreamy individual that wants to express

	disclose any private information.

  	<h1>My anime scoring system</h1>
  	<h2>(Disclaimer: this is "system" is subjective)</h2>
  	The way i've been scoring anime has been bugging me lately, 
 	 Why? Well it seems like it's starting to become complicated, and 
 	 i'm not using any clear metrics when i score these shows and i'd 
 	 prefer having a strucure so i clearly remember how these shows are 
  	compared to each other and in general.
 	 I'm not thinking of making this system objective just strucured 
 	 subjectivity so i don't lose track of my opinions, i kind of need 
  	this because i'd rather score something using an abstraction than 
  	a plain 1 » 10 metric, so i'll probably write reviews aswell so i 
 	 don't forget the shows.
  
  	One question may be why i'm scoring shows, and that i don't clearly 
 	 know myself but i guess i just like making value judgements but at 
 	 the same time i don't like simple metrics.
  	<br>
 	 Here's the idea:<br>
 	 <br>
 	 <dl>
  	 <dt>10</dt>
  	   <dd>- A show i will cherish for the rest of my life </dd>
  	  <dt>9</dt>
    	   <dd>- A truly great show that inspires and change me for the better</dd>
  	 </dl>
