	<h2>What is this site</h2>
	A website I made just to have a website, or basically

	<h2>Why???</h2>
	Why not?
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
	Just some dreamy individual that wants to express
	themselves but at the same time doesn't want to
	disclose any private information.
	<h2>Isn't that contradictory..?</h2>
	Maybe ´_`

  	 <h1 class="title">My anime scoring system</h1>
  	 <h2>(Disclaimer: this is "system" is subjective)</h2>
	    The way I've been scoring anime has been bugging me lately.
	    Why? Well, it seems like it's starting to become complicated,
	    and I'm not using any clear metrics when I score these shows,
	    and I'd prefer having a structure so I could clearly remember
	    how these shows are compared to each other and in general.
	    I'm not thinking of making this system objective;
	    The idea is to concretize subjectivity so I don't lose track of 
	    my opinions.<br><br>
	    I kind of need this because I'd rather score something using an 
	    abstraction than a plain 1 to 10 metric, so I'll probably write 
	    reviews as well so I don't forget the shows. One question may 
	    be why I'm scoring shows, and I don't clearly know myself,
	    but I guess I just like making value judgments, but at the
	    same time, I don't like simple metrics.
  	 <br><br>
 	 Here's the idea:
	 <br><br>
 	 <dl>
  	 <dt>10</dt>
  	   <dd>- A show i will cherish for the rest of my life </dd>
  	  <dt>9</dt>
    	   <dd>- A truly great show that inspires and change me for the better</dd>
  	 </dl>
